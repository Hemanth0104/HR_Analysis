HR Analytics assists us in analysing organisational data. It identifies people-related patterns in data and enables the HR Department to take the necessary actions to keep the business functioning effectively and economically. Attrition is one of the numerous issues that people managers and HR staff must deal with in a business setting.

Surprisingly, machine learning algorithms may be used to identify possible attrition instances, assisting HR personnel in taking the required actions to retain the employee.
